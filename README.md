**Energy A.I. Hackathon 2024 Problem Description**

Goal: Develop a data analytics and machine learning workflow in Python to:

Predict average pump difference during drillout based many possible predictor features for 15 wells. This includes single estimates and an uncertainty model represented by 100 realizations for each well.
Background
When a well is completed, plugs are set to isolate stages. After the well has been hydraulically fractured, those plugs need to be drilled out. For lower-pressure formations, there is an increased uncertainty in bottom hole pressure experienced during drillout. This uncertainty makes it difficult to decide what fluid system to use and makes planning, scheduling, and budgeting post-stimulation operations more difficult. Pump difference is defined as the difference between fluid pumped into the well and fluid returning to the surface. In order to prevent fluid loss we challenge the Energy A.I. Hackathon 2024 teams of The University of Texas at Austin to build a data analytics and machine learning workflow to predict average pump difference with uncertainty.

This will require:

-data analytics and evaluation of multiple data sources over a variety of features
-feature engineering including feature selection, feature transformations, and feature imputation to address missing data
integration of domain expertise at every step
selection, training and tuning of robust machine learning prediction models
-The model will be applied to support determination of optimum fluid type to prevent loss.
